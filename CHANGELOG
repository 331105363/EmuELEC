2.5 

Initial EmuELEC release

Sx05RE is now EmuELEC, a pure emulation build that does not include Kodi or anything else related to Kodi in order to free resources and space.
The main goal of EmuELEC is to be the best and easiest wat to emulate retro games on Amlogic hardware.

However if you still like to have Kodi on the same installation, you can also use the Kodi Add-on version. But keep in mind it will have less features than EmuELEC
